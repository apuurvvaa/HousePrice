# HousePrice

Project Description:

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict house prices using data analysis and visualization tools such as Numpy, matplotlib, and pandas. The model will be built in Python, a widely used programming language for data analysis and machine learning.

The model will be trained on a dataset that contains various features about houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location. Using this data, the model will be able to make predictions about the price of a house based on its characteristics.

Numpy will be used for numerical computations and data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, and pandas for data analysis and preparation. These tools will be used to clean and pre-process the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and train and evaluate the machine learning model.

Once the model is trained, it will be used to make predictions about the prices of houses, which can be useful for real estate agents, homebuyers, and sellers. The model will be evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and mean absolute error to ensure that it is accurate and reliable.

Overall, this project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices in Python using Numpy, matplotlib, and pandas, providing valuable insights into the housing market and helping individuals make informed decisions about buying and selling properties.
